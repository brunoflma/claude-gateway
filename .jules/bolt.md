## 2024-05-30 - Synchronous fs I/O bottleneck
**Learning:** In a local proxy server receiving frequent, potentially concurrent requests (even just `/ping` checks from the frontend), reading a JSON configuration file via synchronous `fs.readFileSync` on every single request acts as a massive bottleneck, severely degrading latency and concurrency handling in Node.js' single-threaded event loop.
**Action:** Always employ caching for file reads on the hot path (like configuration checks). Use a TTL (e.g., 2000ms) to preserve hot-reloading features without destroying performance.
